Adding a parameter to pass will remove it from the","* regular route array. Ex. `\"pass\": [\"slug\"]`.","* -  `persist` is used to define which route parameters should be automatically","* included when generating new URLs. You can override persistent parameters","* by redefining them in a URL or remove them by setting the parameter to `false`.","* Ex. `\"persist\": [\"lang\"]`","* - `multibytePattern` Set to true to enable multibyte pattern support in route","* parameter patterns.","* - `_name` is used to define a specific name for routes. This can be used to optimize","* reverse routing lookups. If undefined a name will be generated for each","* connected route.","* - `_ext` is an array of filename extensions that will be parsed out of the url if present.","* See @link \\UIM\\Routing\\RouteCollection.setExtensions()}.","* - `_method` Only match requests with specific HTTP verbs.","* - `_host` - Define the host name pattern if you want this route to only match","* specific host names.
