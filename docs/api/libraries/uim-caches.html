<p>Caching can be used to make reading from expensive or slow resources faster, by maintaining a second copy of the required data in a faster or closer storage system. For example, you can store the results of expensive queries, or remote webservice access that doesnâ€™t frequently change in a cache. 
Once in the cache, reading data from the cache is much cheaper than accessing the remote resource.</p>
