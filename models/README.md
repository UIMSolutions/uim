In the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, the term **“model”** plays a crucial role.

**Definition**:

- **MVC** stands for **“Model-View-Controller.”**
- It is an application design model that divides related program logic into three interconnected components:
  - **Model**: Represents the **data** and defines the **logic** to manipulate that data.
  - **View**: Handles the **user interface** (what the user sees).
  - **Controller**: Manages processes related to **user input**.
- **MVC** is commonly used for developing modern user interfaces

**Role of the Model**:

- The **model** serves as a **container for everything else**—everything that doesn’t directly involve the user interface.
- Its primary responsibilities include:
  - Holding and managing the **data**.
  - Defining the **business logic** to manipulate that data.
- Each **view** reads from the corresponding **model** to display data in various ways.
- The separation of concerns achieved through the **model** allows flexibility:
  - You can have one model (e.g., a user list) and multiple views that display the data differently.
  - If you need to change views, you won’t impact the model’s logic.

**Example**:

- Suppose you’re building a web application:
  - The **model** might represent user accounts, products, or any other relevant data.
  - Views (web pages) would display this data to users.
  - Controllers handle user interactions (e.g., submitting forms, navigating pages).

In summary, the **model** in **MVC** encapsulates data and logic, promoting a clean separation between different aspects of your application.
