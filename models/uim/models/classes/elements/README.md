Elements are **Plain Old Data (POD)** objects.Â PODs are a concept commonly used in programming.

**Definition**:

- A **POD object** is a data structure that contains only **data members** (variables) and no member functions (methods).
- These objects are **simple**, **self-contained**, and do not have any special behavior associated with them.
- They are often used for **interoperability** between different parts of a program or between different programs.

**Characteristics**:

- **Trivially Copyable**: POD objects can be **safely copied** using bitwise copy operations (like `memcpy`).
- **Standard Layout**: They follow a specific memory layout, making them compatible with C-style structs.
- **No Virtual Functions**: PODs donâ€™t have virtual functions or inheritance.
- **No Constructors/Destructors**: They donâ€™t require custom constructors or destructors.

**Examples**:

- A simple **struct** with only data members (e.g., coordinates, color information).
- **Arrays** of primitive types (integers, floats, etc.).

**Use Cases**:

- **Serialization**: PODs are easy to serialize/deserialize (save/load) from files or network streams.
- **Memory Buffers**: They are useful for working with raw memory buffers
