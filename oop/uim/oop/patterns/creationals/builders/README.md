# Package ğŸ“¦ uim.oop.patterns.creationals.builders

This package contains classes for the Builder Pattern.

This pattern is used to create a complex object with simple objects through a step-by-step approach.

This type of design pattern falls under the Creational category because this pattern represents a way to create an object. A builder class creates the final object step by step. This builder is independent of other objects.
