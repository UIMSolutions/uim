# Package ðŸ“¦ uim.oop.patterns.creationals.prototypes

This package contains classes for using the Prototype Pattern.

This pattern refers to creating duplicate objects with performance in mind.

This type of design pattern falls under the Creative category.

This pattern involves implementing a prototype interface that instructs to create a clone of the current object. This pattern is used when creating an object directly is costly. Example: Objects are to be created based on database operations. From a cached object, a clone can return on the next request and the database can be updated as needed, which can reduce database calls.
