# Package ðŸ“¦ uim.oop.patterns.structural.facade

This package contains classes for the use on the Facade pattern.

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern intended to provide a simplified interface to a library, framework, or other complex set of classes.

This pattern provides a uniform interface to other interfaces of a subsystem. The facade class defines an abstract interface that simplifies the use of the corresponding subsystem.
